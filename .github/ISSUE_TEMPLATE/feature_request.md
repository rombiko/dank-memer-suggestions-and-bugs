the probblem is pets cost a lot of money and not really help you at any point[and if you are passive its worst]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
make that the pets going to help you like:dragon going to give you better stuff when you hunting or the crub[i just pick pet that like water type]can help you fishing or a dog can protect you from cops when you search and so....

maybe you can add more pats that can maybe unlock more commends like a hourse that with him you can do pls travle or when you do pls search its going to show you more opitons when you have hourse...

also maybe the more you use the pet the more it help and the more thing he can do like if the dragon is max he can use fire when someone trying to rob you
